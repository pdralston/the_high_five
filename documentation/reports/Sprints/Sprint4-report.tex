\begin{document}
	\section*{Stop Doing}
		Stop pushing off the work for this project thinking there is a lot of time left.
	\section*{Start Doing}
		Start asking for help and collaboration from people to start pushing out these tasks. We need to also start removing goals that we don't have the time to implement
	\section*{Keep Doing}
		Keep reviewing the pull requests carefully, working hard on getting an mvp pushed out. We need to start really putting in more time and work into this project as we are running out of time.
	\section*{Work Completed/Not Completed}
		In this sprint, we completed no tasks but have been working diligently on what we had already set for us.
	\section*{Work Completion Rate}
		No issues were completed for this sprint. The burnup chart for sprint 4 can be found in the burnup chart directory in this repo
