\begin{document}
	\section*{Stop Doing}
		Stop missing or showing up late to meetings. When members miss meetings it is much harder to ensure that we are all on the same page and that tasks can be completed to the spec we all agree to.
	\section*{Start Doing}
		We need to be more proactive in taking on tasks and devoting more time to them in order to complete what we need to within the sprint time frame.
	\section*{Keep Doing}
		We need to keep delivering quality features. The work that we have completed looks really good and is inline with the UI design that we have in Adobe XD
	\section*{Work Completed/Not Completed}
		No stories completed but we did complete 9 issues including Spikes regarding our dev environment and what our first steps in creating a mobile app are.
	\section*{Work Completion Rate}
		0 stories were completed for this sprint. The burnup chart can be found in the burnup chart directory in this repo
